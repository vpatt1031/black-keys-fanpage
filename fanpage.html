    <h2><center>The History Behind Their Music</center></h2>

    <p>"The powerhouse duo of guitarist and vocalist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney hails from Akron, Ohio, and has gained notice for a raucous blues-based racket that honors the blues-rock tradition while adding elements taken from the do-it-yourself post-punk and garage-rock traditions. The result is a musical soufflée that is equal parts Robert Johnson, Led Zeppelin, the MC5, and Nuggets-era 1960s rock ‘n’ roll minimalism. The group exploded this minimalism, however, with the release of Attack & Release, which was produced by Danger Mouse (Brian Burton) and featured guest musicians Marc Ribot and Ralph Carney from Tom Waits's band. Auerbach and Carney met while both were quite young. They started the Black Keys in 2002 after dropping out of college, taking the band's name from a phrase used by a fellow Akron denizen, a schizophrenic artist who used black keys to describe people who "weren't quite right," according to a National Public Radio segment. While attempting to launch the band, Auerbach and Carney mowed lawns to stay afloat financially."</p>
